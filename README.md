# DevOps E-Commerce Deployment Challenge

## Overview

This project represents a complete deployment of a containerized **E-Commerce Web Application** consisting of:

* Frontend (React)
* Backend (Node.js / Express)
* Database (MongoDB)
* Monitoring stack components

The application is already deployed and functioning in **Microsoft Azure** using a fully containerized architecture.

Your task is to **identify and fix configuration issues** and then successfully **deploy the same solution in AWS (Free Tier)**.

This challenge replicates a **real-world DevOps troubleshooting + cloud migration scenario**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this challenge is to:

* Understand an existing cloud-hosted DevOps setup in Azure
* Detect & solve misconfigurations and stability issues
* Recreate the same architecture in **AWS Free Tier**
* Demonstrate CI/CD, container orchestration, and cloud deployment skills

> ⚠️ *No direct solutions are provided — you are expected to troubleshoot and architect your own working deployment.*

---

## What You Will Work On

As part of this project, you will:

✅ Analyze the existing Azure-based infrastructure
✅ Review and debug container configuration
✅ Fix environment and networking issues
✅ Rebuild images and container services
✅ Deploy equivalent architecture on AWS
✅ Validate application functionality end-to-end

---

## 🌐 Cloud Deployment Target

### Current Platform

* Microsoft Azure (baseline reference)

### Your Deployment Requirement

* **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**
* **AWS Free Tier Only**

This ensures industry-ready experience in **cloud migration and cost-optimized deployment**.

---

## ✅ Expected Outcome

By completing this challenge, you will gain:

✔ End-to-end DevOps deployment experience
✔ Multi-cloud exposure (Azure & AWS)
✔ Docker + CI/CD + Infra debugging practice
✔ Production-like troubleshooting capability

This project how real DevOps teams operate:
**Fix → Migrate → Deploy → Validate → Document**
